# Fractals 
Fractals are some of the coolest things to come out of mathematics ever in my humble opinion and so I wanted to write something that could visualize them.
This repo includes two versions of the same program.
The first is a fully featured fractal viewer that can show a number of different fractal types such as the burning ship, the mandelbrot set, and others.
The second is my attempt to make it as small as possible while retaining basic functionality. 

# To Use
Compile either of the .c files, neither of them need any special libraries. The obfuscated version works with a fixed screen size so that is something to be aware of.
The other version works perfectly fine and resizes to the terminal window size. Running this version with no inputs gives a usage message, too.
Enjoy!
